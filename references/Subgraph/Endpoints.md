The Balancer Subgraph indexes data on the Balancer smart contracts with a GraphQL interface. It updates data in response to function calls and contract events to maintain data on the `Vault`, `Pools`, `AssetManagers` etc, to power front-end apps and integrations.

\*\*Note that Balancer has not yet migrated to the new Subgraph Studio mainnet. Any Balancer subgraphs appearing there should not be considered "official" deployments. Use at your own risk!
