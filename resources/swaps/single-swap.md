# Single Swap

## Function and Struct Definitions

### Swap function

```
swap(SingleSwap singleSwap,
     FundManagement funds,
     uint256 limit,
     uint256 deadline) returns (uint256 amountCalculated[In/Out])
```

* `singleSwap`: A definition of the swap to be executed, defined below
* `funds`: A definition of where funds are going to/from, defined below
* `limit`: The meaning of `limit` depends on the value of `singleSwap.kind`
  * `GIVEN_IN`: The minimum amount of tokens you would accept to receive from the swap.
  * `GIVEN_OUT`: The maximum amount of tokens you would accept having to send for the swap.
* `deadline`: The UNIX timestamp at which our trade must be completed by - if the transaction is confirmed after this time then the transaction will fail.

### SingleSwap struct

The `SingleSwap` struct defines which pool we're trading with and what kind of swap we want to perform. The `SingleSwap` struct is defined as below.

```
enum SwapKind { GIVEN_IN, GIVEN_OUT }

struct SingleSwap {
   bytes32 poolId;
   SwapKind kind;
   IAsset assetIn;
   IAsset assetOut;
   uint256 amount;
   bytes userData;
}
```

* `poolId`: The id of the pool to trade with.
* `kind`: The type of swap we want to perform - either "Out Given In" or "In Given Out." We either know the amount of tokens we're sending to the pool and want to know how many we'll receive, or vice versa.
* `assetIn`: The address of the token which we are sending to the pool.
* `assetOut`: The address of the token which we will receive in return.
* `amount`: The meaning of `amount` depends on the value of `kind`.
  * `GIVEN_IN`: The amount of tokens we are sending to the pool.
  * `GIVEN_OUT`: The amount of tokens we want to receive from the pool.
* `userData`: Any additional data which the pool requires to perform the swap. This allows pools to have more flexible swapping logic in future - for all current Balancer pools this can be left empty.

### FundManagement struct

The `FundManagement` struct defines where the input tokens for the swap are coming from and where the output tokens should be sent. The `FundManagement` struct is defined as below.

```
struct FundManagement {
    address sender;
    bool fromInternalBalance;
    address payable recipient;
    bool toInternalBalance;
}
```

* `sender`: The address from which tokens will be taken to perform the trade
* `fromInternalBalance`: Whether the trade should use tokens owned by the `sender` which are already stored in the Vault.
* `recipient`: The address to which tokens will be sent to after the trade.
* `toInternalBalance`: Whether the tokens should be sent to the `recipient` or stored within their internal balance within the Vault.
